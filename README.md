# guacamole_patch

An unofficial downstream patch for **Apache Guacamole 1.6.0** that improves keyboard and IME recovery after browser tab switching, background suspension, and page lifecycle changes.

This repository is not an official Apache Software Foundation release.

## Quick deployment

The current source is an unreleased `recovery7` candidate. Publish the image through the build workflow before using the tags below. Published `recovery6` images do not include these dialog fixes.

After publishing, pull the candidate image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/info-talent/guacamole_patch:1.6.0-recovery7
```

Use it in Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  guacamole:
    image: ghcr.io/info-talent/guacamole_patch:1.6.0-recovery7
```

Update only the Guacamole web container:

```bash
docker compose pull guacamole
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --no-deps guacamole
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 guacamole
```

Docker reuses unchanged layers, so later pulls normally download only changed layers. Do not run `docker compose down -v` or delete database volumes.

## Image tags

- `1.6.0-recovery7`: unreleased candidate documented by this source checkout.
- `1.6.0-recovery6`: previous recovery release retained for rollback.
- `1.6.0`: current moving release image; this tag is updated on each release build.
- `main`: latest image built from the `main` branch.
- `sha-<commit>`: immutable tag for a specific source commit.
- `dev`: development image built from the `dev` branch.

For production builds, run the workflow from `main`. Running it from `dev` also updates the shared `1.6.0` tag.

## What the patch addresses

### Guacamole Text input with a local IME

```text
Remote Windows language: ENG
Guacamole input method: Text input
Local input method: Chinese IME
```

The patch recovers missing composition events, restores focus to the active connection, restores text/Backspace/Delete delivery, and prevents the hidden raw-keyboard input sink from stealing focus from the visible text field.

### Microsoft Pinyin inside remote Windows

```text
Guacamole input method: None
Local input language: ENG or a local IME
Remote Windows input method: Microsoft Pinyin
RDP keyboard layout: en-us-qwerty
```

The patch resets recorded key state when the page is hidden, restores keyboard capture after returning, releases stuck modifiers, handles long background suspension and page lifecycle events, and rebuilds Chromium's native input context on the first user gesture.

Manual recovery remains available through `Ctrl+Alt+K` and the **Recover keyboard capture** menu action.

### Transient network warning

Terminal error dialogs offer **Reconnect** for the affected client first, with **Refresh page** retained as an explicit fallback. Deferred error translations and authentication checks verify the client, state, and view lifetime before displaying a dialog, so recovered connections are not blocked by stale errors. The dialog no longer owns a separate full-page refresh countdown; connection recovery coordinates automatic page refreshes. Reconnecting a balancing group may select a different backend; use a specific connection when the same host must be preserved.

When the tunnel recovers, its stale recovery suggestion and pending automatic refresh are cleared. Separately detected control stalls remain visible. Persistent disconnects still require matching Guacamole, `guacd`, and proxy logs to identify the underlying cause.

Guacamole normally marks a tunnel unstable after roughly 1.5 seconds without inbound data. The patch waits for three additional seconds of continuous, visible-page instability before showing the warning. It suppresses the warning while the page is hidden and starts a fresh grace period when the page returns.

The underlying instability detector and 15-second receive timeout are unchanged. Sustained network or server failures are still reported and disconnected normally.

An opt-in **Delayed automatic page refresh** switch is available under **User settings → Connection Recovery** and in the current connection menu. It is off by default. When off, no automatic action occurs and the lower-right warning retains **Refresh page**. When enabled, the first confirmed failure refreshes the entire current page after roughly five seconds and the second waits roughly ten seconds. Each browser tab is limited to two consecutive automatic refreshes; one stable minute resets the budget.

If the tunnel remains open but three intentional mouse presses receive no timely remote display sync for eight seconds, recovery also treats the downstream control path as wedged. Guacamole's display statistics and relative sync timing identify network queueing or browser rendering delays above three seconds. Active file transfers, disabling automatic refresh, or selecting **Do not refresh** cancel the pending action. If browser session storage cannot safely persist the cross-refresh counter, automatic refresh is disabled while manual refresh remains available.

A full-page refresh reloads authentication state, routing, and all tiled connections. A balancing group may select another backend and RDP may open a different remote session. Keep the option disabled and use a specific connection when the same host must be preserved.

Recovery6 revalidates the current document with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, clears Guacamole's stale-build refresh lock, and guarantees exactly one reload after request success, failure, or timeout. **Refresh page** is always available in the connection menu and is also shown while waiting for the first remote frame.

### Black remote canvas after login

If Guacamole login and menus work but only the remote canvas is black, first use **Refresh page** in the connection menu. If that fails, restart `guacd` and restore the connection's display settings: leave color depth and DPI empty, and disable force-lossless while leaving **Disable GFX** and all three **disable cache** options unchecked. These settings live in the database and are not reverted with the web image.

### Mouse response under weak networks

High-frequency mouse movement is coalesced to the latest position at roughly 30 Hz. Button presses, releases, right-clicks, wheel events, and drag endpoints flush the latest position first and are sent immediately, preventing clicks from waiting behind stale movement. Pending movement is discarded when the connection is replaced.

### High display load from a remote browser

Chrome, Edge, video, animation, and complex page scrolling inside remote Windows generate substantial RDP display traffic. The patch detects severe backlog and recovers the connection, but cannot remove bottlenecks in the remote host, network, or `guacd` encoder. For the specific Guacamole RDP connection, prefer:

Recovery6 retains recovery4's display hot-path optimization: the live sync callback no longer flattens the full display every five seconds for thumbnails, and per-frame statistics are disabled by default and enabled with a one-second window only after intentional clicks. Thumbnails are still saved after the first connected frame and on disconnect.

- matching web application and `guacd` versions; the web patch does not upgrade `guacd`;
- GFX enabled by default (**Disable GFX** unchecked), with color depth initially unset; Guacamole 1.6.0 requires 32-bit depth for GFX and ignores a requested `16`, so lower color depth is not a universal optimization;
- force-lossless disabled;
- wallpaper, theming, font smoothing, full-window drag, desktop composition, and menu animations disabled;
- bitmap, offscreen, and glyph caching enabled by leaving their "disable" options unchecked;
- `1280x720` or `1600x900` with `96` DPI during initial troubleshooting.

If mstsc is smooth but Guacamole stalls when opening or scrolling a browser, check gateway graphics conversion, transport, and local browser rendering first. Confirm that `websocket-tunnel` successfully upgrades to WebSocket (typically HTTP `101`); if it falls back to the HTTP tunnel, check that the reverse proxy disables response buffering. During a stall, compare `docker stats` CPU, memory, and network traffic with local browser CPU, then compare lower resolution and access without the proxy on the same network. The paths and RDP negotiation differ, so smooth mstsc alone does not rule out network issues between the Guacamole server and Windows.

## Acceptance testing

See [TEST_MATRIX.md](TEST_MATRIX.md) for the complete procedure. At minimum, verify:

- local Chinese IME with remote Windows set to ENG;
- remote Microsoft Pinyin candidate selection;
- repeated tab switching in Chrome and Edge;
- no stuck Ctrl, Shift, or Alt keys;
- Backspace, Delete, arrow keys, Enter, and numeric candidate selection;
- reconnecting the same account;
- rollback to a known working image.

## Scope and limitations

The patch does not modify `guacd`, PostgreSQL schema or data, Nginx, FRP, connection accounts, recordings, or shared directories.

Shortcuts such as `Win+Space` and `Alt+Tab` may be intercepted by the local operating system or browser. Validate the image against the actual Windows RDP environment before production rollout.
